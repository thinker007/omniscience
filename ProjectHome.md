Omniscience is a project concerned with creating the semantic web. It takes the perspective of having users create, update, and organize all the worlds objects in such a way that computers can read and understand them.

Rather than approaching the problem from an ontological or format perspective similar to the W3C, this project is concerned with defining the data as it is entered. Let's get the data in there, in an organized enough fashion, and then refine it continuously, similar to the recently announced [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com).

Please see [the project's google group](http://groups.google.com/group/omniscienceproject) for more information.
